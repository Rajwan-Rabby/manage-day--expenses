# manage-day--expenses
we are developing an application to manage the day to day expenses (with unique transaction ID, description, amount, category, date, and any other relevant features) for an individual. Our system should allow users to add new transactions, delete tramactions, update wrongly inputted transactions, categorize expenses, and generate monthly spending reports.
